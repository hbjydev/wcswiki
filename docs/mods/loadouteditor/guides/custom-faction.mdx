# Setting up a custom faction

If you're trying to use WCS_LoadoutEditor with a custom faction, there's a small
amount of setup you need to do in order to make sure your players can access
their saved loadout slots, regardless of what kind of mission you're trying to
run.

## Overriding the LoadoutManager prefabs

1. Find the `LoadoutManager_Editor` prefab in the resource browser. This
    will be located in `ArmaReforger/Prefabs/MP/Managers/Loadouts`.

2. Right-click on the prefab and choose "Override in '...'".
3. Right-click on the new, overridden prefab, and click "Edit Prefab(s)".

## Adding loadout slots for your faction

Once you're in the LoadoutManager prefab, we need to add our new loadout slots.

1. Click into the `SCR_LoadoutManager` component on the right side of the
   screen.

2. Scroll down to "Loadout Manager", then "Player Loadouts".

3. Add a new item to the "Player Loadouts" list. Use the
   `SCR_PlayerArsenalLoadout` class.

    1. Set the Loadout Name to "Slot 1".
    2. Set the Loadout Resource to your faction's base loadout prefab.
    3. Ignore the Loadout Image.
    4. Set Affiliated Faction to your faction key. (This has to match _exactly_)
    5. Set the WCS Slot Id value to `Slot1` exactly.

4. Duplicate the loadout slot we just created, and change the loadout name to
   "Slot 2". Then set the WCS Slot Id to `Slot2` exactly.

5. Duplicate the loadout slot we created, and change the loadout name to
   "Slot 3". Then set the WCS Slot Id to `Slot3` exactly.

6. Once you've added all three required slots, save the prefab.

All GM scenarios should now include WCS Loadout Editor slots for your custom
faction.

:::note

The slots will only appear once a loadout has been saved to them, so don't panic
if you only see the default loadout in the respawn menu. Spawn a weapons &amp;
equipment arsenal and make a quick test loadout, then save it and respawn. You
should now see that the slot you saved it to is now available.
